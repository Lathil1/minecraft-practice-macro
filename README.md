# minecraft-practice-macro
Put the seeds in the seeds.txt, change the hotkey at the bottom of macro.ahk, run macro, go to the title screen of minecraft, press hotkey.

the text you can put on the seeds.txt can include other text, each line has to include at most 1, if it doesnt have any seeds, it just deletes it and goes to the next seed

The macro.ahk is a direct copy from pastas macro that fetches seeds from the leaderboards, you can find it here https://github.com/pastahub/practice_macro
